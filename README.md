# Python
This repository was created to keep track of my python progress. 
For now we have 2 branches here:
1. Beginning of Python: Here we have some basic tasks which was done at the very beginning of my python journey. All tasks here are from Mosh's Python Course.
2. Projects Done By Me: Here we can see all the projects I have done individually.
